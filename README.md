Course material, 2nd semester a.y. 2024/2025, Dept. of Computer Science

## News üóûÔ∏è
- **07/02/2025:** The course website is online. Welcome to DLAI 2024/25! **The course will start on Mon 3rd March**.

## Logistics üß≠

**Lecturer:** Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†

**Assistants:** [Dr. Daniele Solombrino](https://github.com/dansolombrino/), [Dr. Giorgio Strano](https://github.com/giorgioskij/)

**When:** Mondays 14:00--16:00 and Tuesdays 13:00--16:00

**Where:**

Physical classroom: Aula L1 - Castro Laurenziano (RM018-E01PTEL026)

There is no virtual classroom, and the lectures will not be recorded.

## Pre-requisites üîë

Python fundamentals; calculus; linear algebra.

## Textbook, reading materials and video recordings üìñ

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

In addition:

- [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKU5nSAU-klicJEPxIiADDvuYbZF1Vpd) you can find video recordings of 2025 lectures
- In the GitHub pages of the previous academic years you can find longer versions of some video lectures
- [here](https://github.com/erodola/numMeth-s2-2022) you can find video recordings about topics that may come in handy when studying deep learning
- [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2022/raw/main/resources/Course_notes_Crisostomi.pdf) you can find some supplementary course notes
- [here](https://github.com/FFMasterSlave/DLAI-alternative-notes/tree/main) you can find annotated slides
- [here](https://github.com/dansolombrino/DLAI-2022-23) you can find Anki flashcards on theoretical and practical lectures

Thanks to past and present students for the kind contributions!

**Accessibility üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è**: Since last year, in an effort to create a more inclusive and accessible learning environment, all slides have been re-designed with readability in mind to support students with specific learning disabilities. We aim to ensure that everyone, regardless of learning differences, has equal access to the educational content provided. Should you need additional accommodations or have suggestions for further improving accessibility, please feel free to reach out.

## Grading üìä

**Exam dates**
*TBD*

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 100% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

We may require an oral exam in doubtful cases or whenever necessary.

- Project list: *forthcoming*.
- The template for the final project report is [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2025/raw/main/template.zip).

## Past exams üìë 

Exam is now project-only, but you can still find some past theoretical questions [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hwafIolYEOEjJYRnyKg2kodFqgKDZklZ)
