## Textbook and reading material 📖

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

In addition:

- [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2022/raw/main/resources/Course_notes_Crisostomi.pdf) you can find some supplementary course notes, and...
- [here](https://github.com/FFMasterSlave/DLAI-alternative-notes/tree/main) you can find annotated slides.

Both of the above are a kind contribution by former students of past editions of this course.

**Accessibility 👁️‍🗨️**: Since last year, in an effort to create a more inclusive and accessible learning environment, all slides have been re-designed with readability in mind to support students with specific learning disabilities. We aim to ensure that everyone, regardless of learning differences, has equal access to the educational content provided. Should you need additional accommodations or have suggestions for further improving accessibility, please feel free to reach out.

## Grading 📊
